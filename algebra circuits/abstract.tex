		The use of graphical language in quantum computing for the representation of algorithms, although intuitive, is not very useful for different tasks such as the description of quantum circuits in text environments, the calculation of quantum states or the optimization of quantum circuits. While classical circuits can be represented either by circuit graphs or by Boolean expressions, quantum circuits have until now predominantly been illustrated as circuit graphs because no formal language for quantum circuits that allows algebraic manipulations has so far been accepted. This work proposes a means to represent quantum circuits in a convenient and concise manner, similar to the way Boolean expressions are used in classical circuits. The proposed notation allows the consistent and parameterized description of quantum algorithms, as well as the easy handling of the elements that compose it to achieve powerful optimizations in the number of gates of the circuits. To visualize it, a software implementation of an algebraic quantum circuit framework has been made, which allows describing quantum circuits, as well as their respective state vectors, using the proposed algebraic language.
