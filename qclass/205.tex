\subsection{Two Qubits}
The state $\ket{ab}$ means that $\ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$.

The gate $\gate{H}^{\otimes 2}$ means that $\gate{H}\otimes\gate{H}$.

\subsection{Phase Kickback}
We observe another interesting quantum effect.
We apply a Controlled-NOT operator, but the controller qubit will be affected!

$\gate{X}^1_2\ket{+-}=\ket{--}$

\subsection{Entanglement and Superdense Coding}
If the quantum state of two qubits can be written as $\ket{uv}$, then two qubits are not correlated.
On the other hand, if the quantum state of two qubits cannot be written as $\ket{uv}$, then there is an entanglement between the qubits.

The superdense coding circuit is
\begin{equation*}
\gate{H}_1 \gate{X}^1_2 \gate{Z}_{1}\gate{X}^1_2\gate{H}_1
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Quantum Teleportation}
The quantum teleportation circuit is
\begin{equation*}
	\gate{Z}^1_3\gate{X}^2_3\gate{H}_1\gate{X}^1_{2}\gate{X}^2_3\gate{H}_2
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Multiple Control Constructions}
We can have a multi controled gate, for example $X^{1,2}_3$ the Toffoli gate.
